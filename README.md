Research on Cape Town suburbs and towns which can be used to make a decision on purchasing property in Cape Town.

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ADGVLOGS/Cape-Town-Project/blob/main/DurbanvilleSuburbs.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Interactive Demo"/></a>


### Feel free to look at the Jupyter notebooks for any ideas
	- CapeTown.ipynb is used to generate visual heat map of population in Cape Town
	- DurbanvilleSuburbs.ipynb is used to generate a .csv with given headers 
		Suburb
		Latitude
		Longtitude
		Distance(KM) (This is distance from V&A Waterfront to Point B can be changed in script)
		Height above sea level(m) (why we calculated this? more elevation = better view of scenary - hypothesis)
		
	- can be used given a provided array of Suburbs/Streets/Places example 
		['Durbanville Hills','Vergesig','Clifton']
